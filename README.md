# 8_Battery_temperature_guard

I wanted to increase the safety of charging batteries for RC models, so I decided, at the urging of my friend, to build an additional device signaling the increased charging temperature of the LiPol package.

The principle of operation should be simple - the package temperature has reached the set temperature, the buzzer is activated and an arrow appears on the display, indicating which package is wrong. SkyRC chargers - it has the ability to connect thermometers but ... only four. When loading packages in parallel, more thermometers are needed.
